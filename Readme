-----------------------------------Data Science practice project with (Python & SQL)----------------------------

As a data scientist working for a data analytics firm.  the firm has explored a multitude of data sources 
and is tasked with providing key insights that your clients can make actionable. you're asked to 
provide some data analytics guidance for one of the firm’s clients.

In a typical scenario, you would iteratively work with your client to understand the data wanting to be analyzed.
Having a solid understanding of the data and any underlying assumptions present is crucial to the success of a 
data analysis project.  However, in this case, you will need to do a little more of the “heavy lifting”.


## Milestone 1 :________________________________________________________________________________________________

    To begin, you will prepare a project proposal detailing: 

    The questions we are wanting to answer, 
    initial hypothesis about the data relationships, and 
    the approach you will take to get your answers.  

    NOTE: The proposal is just a plan for how we will travel.  
    It’s there to help keep you on your path by keeping the end goal in mind.
    You will then execute your plan and in the end present your findings in a month to your management.

    The project proposal you will develop will guide you where you want to go, but may change along the way;
    and that’s OK! To kick things off you will need to:

        Explore and understand your data
        Develop an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

    For this milestone, you will develop a project proposal where you'll include:
    
	------ 1 Description
	Write a 5-6 sentence paragraph describing your project
	Include who might be interested to learn about your findings. 
	Who might be your audience?

	------ 2 Questions :
	Create 2-3 questions that you want to answer with the data:
	This will be easier to answer once you've had an opportunity to look at the data and do some 
	initial exploration.
	Don't get carried away on the analysis piece at this stage as there will be more analysis later.
	Do focus on key data elements that are present. 
	For instance: What are they, when are they, who are they about? Do they connect? 
	How do they connect? Jot down ideas as you brainstorm.

	------ 3 Hypothesis :
	What are your initial hypotheses about the data?
	Write 2-3 assumptions about the data that you'll want to go back to prove or disprove. 
	You will want to keep them in front of you as you look at the   data to keep them or change them. 
	You may see relationships that you want to explore and will develop a "belief" about the data.  

	Start documenting what you think you can tell from the data. 
	What pops up as interesting to you? Most likely it will be interesting to others as well.
	Use the discussion boards to discuss with others about your client and the data to brainstorm together.

	------ 4 Approach :
	Describe what approach you are going to take in order to prove/disprove your hypotheses. 

	Think about the following in your answer:  
	What features (fields/columns) are you going to look at first?
	Is there a relationship that exists that you want to explore?
	What metric/ evaluation measure will you use?
                
## Milestone 2 :_________________________________________________________________________________________________
you’ve done the prep, now it’s time to dive in and start executing the Project Proposal.  
You’ve done the hard part; making the plan.  

Start looking at your data and perform some initial stats to get a good feel about what 
you have available to you. You’ll focus your efforts on understanding the ins-and-outs 
of the data and perform some descriptive stats.

Keep your questions and your hypotheses in mind; it’s very easy to start down “rabbit-holes”
and have to bring yourself 
back up for air to realize that you lost time chasing that rabbit.

Nonetheless, it’s part of the journey. What if your hypothesis is wrong? No problem!

You've discovered a relationship that was thought to be present but isn't! That's great analysis! So now what?
Document your discovery … this may be something your client didn’t know or was an assumption they made as well.
Insights are insights and data is data … you are not responsible for what the data says, it just is.
Your job is to let the data speak to you.

What if your hypothesis is right? Yay for you, you discovered something out of your initial analysis of the data, 
relationships and assumptions that proved to be true. Start thinking about how to characterize that finding? 
What’s the story you want to tell? How best to tell it? You can think about visually, just key points, a narrative?

Iterate on these steps to get a few good hypothesis/questions to answer and prove out.
	
## Milestone 3 :_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Beyond descriptive statistics, there are other things we can do for analysis that vary depending 
on the kinds of datasets we encounter.  For example, when looking at text analytics we can apply 
many models and analytical techniques (term frequency, topic modeling, etc.). 
In addition, at this phase, you can start looking at combinations of features as well as new 
metrics to further your story about the data.  Understanding relationships between data can help 
you create deeper insights into the data being analyzed.   

---- Dive Deeper : Look deeper into the features you are investigating, consider:

    Relationships / Correlation, Pearson Correlation
    Linear Regression for future prediction (if the relationship is linear)
    Textual Analysis for TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency; 
    Row-based and column-based, stop-word removal?

    Specify 1-2 correlations you discovered. List the fields that you found to be correlated and describe
    what you learned from these correlations.
	
---- Go Broader : Expand the features you are investigating. Look for connections/relationships that you 
may have initially missed.

    What jumps out at you now?
    Use the descriptive stats to point you to features that you may now want to consider.

    What key terms did you discover in any text analysis, for whom? Any themes?
    If you are not analyzing text, summarize what other things you are considering in your analysis?
	
---- New Metric : Create 1 or 2 new metrics to track relationships of data you discovered. Explain why you created them.

## Milestone 4 :_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now that you’ve completed your analysis, it’s time to tell the story.  
Your presentation must include:

--- Build on Project Proposal

Build on your project proposal (from Milestone 1) that described the client or dataset you chose, 
the approach you were going to take, your initial hypotheses, and your initial approach. 
Include descriptive stats and any visualizations from your data exploration. 
You want to highlight key learnings from your data exploration and any changes to your plan as a results of your findings:

    Include Client/Hypotheses/Approach
    Include artifacts from previous modules
    Include results (good and bad paths); Correlations / regressions
    Graphics / Visualizations

---- Discuss Insights Discovered

Discuss results from your diving deeper / going broader analysis). This is where you put your 
spin on what you’ve discovered

    Discuss your hypotheses and any direct outcomes from whether you were right or wrong.  
    Did you change your hypotheses? Or create new ones?
    Discuss any metrics you created and why?
    Discuss discoveries about relationships in the data / themes discovered.

---- Recommendations and Actions

Summarize the insights you found and make recommendations on what your client should do. 
What is the next steps or the action that should be taken as a result of your analysis?
